# FINGERPRINT-BASED-ATM-SYSTEM
This is a concept to promote the security of the users and to get the banks to its next level.
  Our aim is to evolve a far better guarding system by the usage of fingerprint based ATMs. The two key functions given by a biometric system are identification and therefore the other is verification.
  Fingerprint processing is widely accepted these days and may be a fully developed biometric technology is effortless to develop for an advanced stage of security and safety at the fingertips.
  Thus, the recognition of fingerprint is taken into account between the minimum disruption and annoyance of all biometric verification procedures. Though fingerprint images are captured at first, the pictures aren't stored anywhere in the system. Not regenerate it.Hence, mishandling of the system is not possible.
